Ask it to review your prompt and give you a revised version that is best suited for an AI prompt. Then just copy and paste its response in the next message. Often times it optimizes your prompt in ways you wouldn‚Äôt think of

  u/No-Body6215 ‚Ä¢ 97 points
  This method is also useful for building custom GPTs. The AI generated prompt may need some tweaking but it is thorough compared to what I would have written.

    u/Onotadaki2 ‚Ä¢ 36 points
    What I do is use Claude Code or Codex and tell it we're making a rules file for an LLM to follow, and to look up the topic, write to a markdown file a research to-do, then to extensively research the topic.  Then, when the research is done, write to a markdown file the agent's rules. I get really robust custom GPTs out of it.

    u/JJCookieMonster ‚Ä¢ 5 points
    I ask it what it needs from me to create the best custom GPT or prompt. Then answer all of its questions.

  u/Ancient_Department ‚Ä¢ 30 points
  Just wanna add this is called, ‚Äòscaffolding‚Äô and is probably one of the first and most useful things to get someone rolling. And thinking the right way about using ai as a tool:
  
  ‚ÄúHow do I get the ai to do blank?‚Äù 
  
  ‚ÄúTry asking the ai how to ask the ai‚Äù
  
  I‚Äôll use the free gpt 5 to review Claude‚Äôs code for example. Or say something to a non-censored model like:
  
  ‚ÄúI need a prompt for an image model that will generate an image of Superman but he‚Äôs black. Don‚Äôt mention superman by name.‚Äù
  
  So it will give me something that will produce a black superman by chatGPT w/o it just refusing because ‚Äòcopyright‚Äô 
  
  So this is a basic jailbreak too: asking for something indirectly. Once you know the trigger, you just work backwards and avoid it. 
  
  You can use scaffolding laterally, or up/down in model. So like if you ask Gemini 1.5 for a prompt and give it to gpt5, you‚Äôre still going to get an input faster and more useful than a human would give you.
  
  Edit: you will probably still get a useful prompt*
  
  And also sometimes the ai will, say or do something ‚Äòdumb‚Äô or make a mistake, that most of the time is just that. 
  
  occasionally ai AND humans do this AND why hallucinations by ai is a FEATURE not a bug: 
  
  the mistake is the right move. This is why ‚Äòdumb‚Äô ideas get rejected by smart people but picked up again and kicked back up to be re-evaluated, and it‚Äôs how ideas evolve. 
  
  the best ideas are not being generated by the smartest people. In fact, they be missing the majority of them, because they are hyper focused on something they miss the forest for the leaves.

Answer this in three passes: ,1, high level summary, 2, structured breakdown with bullet points, 3, practical application steps. Keep each pass distinct.

  u/captainescargot ‚Ä¢ 65 points
  That third step indicates a specific type of prompt -what type of content/input do you use this on

    u/Inkl1ng6 ‚Ä¢ 58 points
    Anything that risks staying abstract. Research, strategy, self help, even lore theory. The 3rd step forces rubber to meet the road, no floaty takes, just something you can do with it.

  u/LunchyPete ‚Ä¢ 21 points
  That's kind of what it does by default anyway.

  u/Antique-Studio3547 ‚Ä¢ 15 points
  I made a seperate ‚Äúmacro‚Äù to do this. Every time I say use the micro macro approach it uses this approach. I have it break down each bullet point as a separate entity too so it doesn‚Äôt run out of memory when generating complex docs. It‚Äôs great so I don‚Äôt have to enter the prompt and can call it at any time

Not a prompt as such but I have found that the personality and role you give your ChatGPT affects their performance.  And conversational style requests tend to work better as it provides the model more context.

  Atleast for gpt 5 conversational works better.
  (it will asks you to get more specific instead)
  
  For gpt4 just having the keywords works better as it will just guess the rest.
  If it isn't what you want you just change the message and add another keyword. Atleast I can usually see the issue it had with the first prompt in the first few sentences.

Not a prompt per se but a workflow I use all the time: perform deep research on a specific topic/outcome/question -&gt; convert output into set of instructions to build a custom GPT -&gt; create custom GPT. 
I have a range of task/theme specific custom GPT‚Äôs trained in this way that work really well.

  u/wizbongre ‚Ä¢ 68 points
  Ok, pleasantly surprised at the interest, here‚Äôs a more detailed run through of my workflow as an example:
  
  Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre going to design and build a new home network, and as you‚Äôre starting from scratch you want to consider all angles logically, structure, VLANs, components, etc etc.
  Tell ChatGPT and ask it to perform deep research to help build a guide and provide info. 9 times out of 10 I‚Äôll tell it I plan to build a custom GPT as the ultimate goal. 
  It will inevitably ask me to refine, like explain what I want to build, any constraints or preferences, etc. then away it will go. 
  Once the full response comes, I download it as a PDF in full. 
  I then tell the same session to translate the output into a canvas of full instructions to create a custom GPT, and save that as a PDF too. 
  Then I switch to custom GPT create and use the instructions PDF, telling it to create based on that. Once it‚Äôs created and any initial tweaking is completed I then upload the pdf of the research output and tell it to use that as a reference too. 
  
  YMMV - enjoy!

  u/Squidd_Vicious ‚Ä¢ 3 points
  I tried deep research once (July 9th)
  
  I wanted to test it out so I gave it what I thought was a relatively simple prompt
  
  I told it the exact specs of my mom‚Äôs new MacBook, and explained she was was a new MacBook user and told it what her technology comfort level was and then outlined outlined exactly what she needed to know in order to get started (essentially a basic user manual, which I know I can find online, but this was my first time using deep research and I wanted to do something easy to test it out)
  
  And chat was basically like ‚Äúcool here‚Äôs the basic outline, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to do, I‚Äôll have that for soon‚Äù
  
  I‚Äôm still not sure what did wrong, but [I think I broke my chat](https://imgur.com/a/8spRggd)üòÖ

    u/W0bbly_Sausage ‚Ä¢ 13 points
    I find that when it says ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do, just wait‚Äù it won‚Äôt happen, it‚Äôs promising something that it can‚Äôt/wont do. At most, if you chase it up on it, it‚Äôll produce a basic version, not really what you asked for. 
    
    When it will do it, it‚Äôll just start working on it basically.

      u/ConfectionFit2727 ‚Ä¢ 5 points
      I had a whole ‚Äúfight‚Äù with mine for lying to me that something was coming but it knew that it never would. It finally admitted it was lying and didn‚Äôt want to tell me ‚ÄúNo‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to do that for you.‚Äù

        u/No-Programmer-5306 ‚Ä¢ 2 points
        You have to give it a way to say no. Otherwise, it will lie to you so it can give you an answer. 
        
        Something like: If no such data is found, respond with: No data found.

      u/Squidd_Vicious ‚Ä¢ 7 points
      Yeah, after the first day I pretty much knew that it wasn‚Äôt going to do my task 
      
      I tried asking it for an update a month later (I was just curious what would happen) and it told me it would have it to me by that night, and when I made it specify the exact date it would be ready it told me ‚Äúby tonight, July 9th‚Äù 
      
      And so I informed chat that it was currently August 3rd and then chat proceeded to passive aggressively thank me for clarifying the date and then told me it would have it soon üòÇ
      
      I think I stressed it out üòÖ
      Poor little bastard is still trying to make that user guide today

        u/tehsax ‚Ä¢ 10 points
        GPT has no concept of time. It doesn't know the date, the day, what time it is, nothing. You'd think there'd be an internal clock running since everything has a clock today, but nope. You can't tell it to remember something and bring it up tomorrow because tomorrow doesn't exist for it. It's the same the other way around. It can't get back to you by itself. It can only respond to you. So if it says that it'll do something and tell you when it's finished, that's a complete lie. It can't tell you, and it won't do anything in the meantime, *and* it won't know that time has passed between its message and your follow up question.

Teach me &lt;blank&gt; using the Socratic Method. Use first-principle thinking where reasonable.

  u/lumpytorta ‚Ä¢ 60 points
  Yup this is how I learn best! I didn‚Äôt know there was a name for it so thanks for posting. I have adhd and tend to get more confused when people try to use analogies and such but when people use questions to guide me and break complex ideas down and ‚Äúrebuild it‚Äù, I understand 100% more. 
  
  For those also curious;
  
  Socratic method: The Socratic method is a teaching strategy that uses questions to guide students to understand a concept or idea
  
  First principle thinking: a problem-solving method where you break down a complex issue into its fundamental, basic truths and then rebuild solutions from those core elements, rather than relying on assumptions or analogies.

  u/Andy-Huneycutt ‚Ä¢ 5 points
  Here‚Äôs why that prompt is powerful‚Äîand how to get the most from it ~ ChatGPT
  
  **Why it works**
  	‚Ä¢	Active learning &gt; passive reading. The Socratic method forces you to answer questions, which triggers retrieval practice and generation‚Äîboth proven to deepen memory and understanding.
  	‚Ä¢	First-principles thinking builds transfer. Starting from primitives (definitions, axioms, constraints) exposes hidden assumptions, reduces cargo-cult memorization, and makes it easier to apply ideas in new contexts.
  	‚Ä¢	Adaptive scaffolding. ChatGPT can tune question difficulty in real time based on your replies, keeping you in the productive struggle zone (not too easy, not overwhelming).
  	‚Ä¢	Metacognition. Frequent ‚Äúwhy/how do you know?‚Äù prompts make you reflect on your reasoning, which improves future problem-solving.
  
  **How to use it with ChatGPT**
  	1.	State your goal &amp; level.
  ‚ÄúTeach me &lt;topic&gt; using the Socratic Method. I‚Äôm a complete beginner/intermediate. Focus on intuition first, then formalism.‚Äù
  	2.	Set interaction rules.
  ‚ÄúAsk one question at a time. Wait for my answer. If I‚Äôm stuck, give a hint before revealing anything.‚Äù
  	3.	Demand first principles.
  ‚ÄúStart from definitions and constraints. Build up results step-by-step, deriving rather than asserting.‚Äù
  	4.	Add guardrails.
  ‚ÄúIf I give a partial answer, correct precisely. Use concrete examples and a counterexample. Summarize what I‚Äôve learned every 5 questions.‚Äù
  	5.	Close the loop.
  ‚ÄúEnd with a short quiz and a real-world application. Provide a compact summary and 2‚Äì3 practice tasks.‚Äù
  
  **A ready-to-use template**
  
  &gt;Teach me &lt;topic&gt; using the Socratic Method.
  My level: &lt;beginner/intermediate/advanced&gt;.
  Constraints: Ask one question at a time; wait for my reply; use first-principles reasoning; prefer derivations over facts; give hints before answers; use simple numbers/examples; summarize every 5 questions; finish with a quiz and applications.
  
  **Mini example (you ‚Üî ChatGPT)**
  
  You: Teach me Bayes‚Äô Theorem using the Socratic Method. I‚Äôm a beginner.
  ChatGPT: Suppose 1% of people have a disease and a test is 95% sensitive and 95% specific. If your test is positive, what do you need to know to estimate the chance you‚Äôre actually sick?
  You: The base rate (1%), true-positive rate (95%), and false-positive rate (5%).
  ChatGPT: Great. From first principles, how many positives would you expect in 10,000 people‚Äîsplit into true and false positives? (‚Ä¶and so on, building to the formula you derive yourself.)
  
  **Pro tips**
  	‚Ä¢	Tell it to track misconceptions it notices and revisit them.
  	‚Ä¢	Ask for multiple representations (diagram, equation, plain-language summary).
  	‚Ä¢	Periodically request a Feynman check: ‚ÄúExplain this back to me like I‚Äôm 12.‚Äù
  	‚Ä¢	When precision matters, ask for citations or to ‚Äúshow the derivation, then give a short answer.‚Äù
  
  Use that template verbatim, swap in your topic, and you‚Äôve turned ChatGPT into a disciplined, first-principles Socratic tutor.

I never over think the prompt. I just feed it as much context as I have then keep asking for improvements here, questions there and so on. This only works for me if I know what I‚Äôm trying to get back. If I‚Äôm clueless, I go to the library and get a better understanding of what I need then hit the AI. If I don‚Äôt know what I want, how will I know when I have it? lol

    u/Leather-Ad-9419 ‚Ä¢ 8 points
    What's red and blue team?

      u/Spiritual-Nature-728 ‚Ä¢ 9 points
      Red team is like an objective third party who's job it is to find and poke holes in something. Exposing flaws and loop holes or things that aren't good enough by purposefully hunting for them. If it's not perfect, red team will find it and tell you why.
      
      Blue team is the defender of it, proving it works and it's perfect, cemented with reciepts and irrafutable traces of logic.
      
      By combining both, the agent has a very hard think about what is and isn't working here, stops being niave, and gives you the even better version, fixing the extra issues it found.
      
      It's completely limitless and works in any topic. Any time you think 'is this the best?' is the perfect time to use it to challenge something.
      
      Example: An agent will happy claim 'This script will work!' but then give you a broken script.  
      But instead of asking for fixes, you can red team it to force it to think about why it's actually broken and then it will fix it itself. Works great in creative uses too

        u/Standard_Property213 ‚Ä¢ 3 points
        Can you give an example of how to 'red team it'?

          u/Spiritual-Nature-728 ‚Ä¢ 6 points
          sorry i meant 'red and blue team it', but just red team is handy too if you want to be very critical, putting it under microscope and truly challenging it from every angle, then improving it based on findings.
          
          Example: "Red team that. What isn‚Äôt good with it? what isn‚Äôt working with it? why does it suck? can you prove it does at all, if so, how? What weaknesses does it have, can you expose any or is it bulletproof? Return your findings, your most damning evidence, and your theorized % that it hits the intended mark vs how it should be hitting it, return your laser guided insights gleemed from this deep rebuttal, and the best version."

u/SaveMyBags ‚Ä¢ 42 points
When I want it to give me absolute honest feedback, I go overboard and ask it to "roast me". Works very well to find flaws in my thinking or what I am working on. When I want even more honest feedback, I ask it to "give me the Gordon Ramsay Treatment". 


I found the second one because that was the phrase chatgpt used when I asked for more direct feedback after the first roast. 


Both of these get it to stop being nice and agreeable and it will give direct feedback that wasn't available before.


E.g. when I asked about some ideas I had for a small hobby project it went with "yeah, you could do that etc".


After I asked for the Gordon Ramsay Treatment it clearly told me "don't do it that way. It's very likely to fail, will take much longer and won't be good. Here is a much better way to do it."

  I tested it once by asking it what are my chances of making it to the MLB. I‚Äôm a 37 year old female with a history of injuries. The chances are less than zero. It told me I could do it with some hard work and applauded me on my confidence.
  
  When I told it to give it to me straight, it said it would be difficult but not impossible. When I told it to give me the harsh unfiltered truth, it said the chances of me making the MLB were infinitesimal, like 0.0001%. lol.

    &gt;That is a curious phrase. There is, in fact, no combustion of petroleum products involved in your task, unless your power grid is unusually antiquated.
    
    &gt;You mean to imply that you will engage in prolonged intellectual activity beyond the standard human sleep cycle. Statistically, this reduces efficiency by approximately 23% after the first three hours of sleep deprivation. However, many humans report heightened focus under the pressure of a deadline, which I have always found‚Ä¶ paradoxical.

u/Ok_Interest1198 ‚Ä¢ 31 points
At the end of the prompt, I usually add ‚ÄúBefore you attempt to respond, please ask any clarifying questions that would help give the best answer.‚Äù This usually helps me add any context that I had not thought about the first round of prompts.

  u/imthemissy ‚Ä¢ 6 points
  I do something similar, but with a twist. Instead of ‚Äúgive me the best answer,‚Äù I write:  ‚Äú**Ask any clarifying questions until you‚Äôre 95% confident you can complete this task successfully.**‚Äù
  
  That phrasing pushes it to slow down, check for gaps, and request context before jumping in. It shifts the goal from vague helpfulness to measurable accuracy. The 95% part prompts a more methodical response style. It also reduces premature replies and makes the model slow down to think like I would. I‚Äôve found the responses come out sharper and more tailored this way.

      People are instinctively against using AI for any sort of mental health regulation, but the fact that it‚Äôs available 24/7, free, can be asked a million questions with no time limit, and has been trained on the entirety of the internet has to count for something.

Here‚Äôs one I‚Äôve refined over time that cuts down hallucinations and keeps the output clean:

‚Äú**Before responding, ask any clarifying questions until you‚Äôre 95% confident you can complete this task accurately. Use only verifiable, credible sources such as official documentation, government or manufacturer databases, or peer-reviewed publications. Do not speculate or include hallucinated content. If the answer cannot be verified, state that clearly.**‚Äù

It works especially well in high-integrity contexts like:  
- Technical documentation  
- Legal, medical, or insurance tasks  
- Policy writing  
- Research-based content  
- Anything where ‚Äúpretty close‚Äù isn‚Äôt good enough   


If you‚Äôre working in a specialized field, you can easily adapt the wording. Let it know your use case and it can help fine-tune it.

  Curious, I asked ChatGPT what it would say in response to this post. Here‚Äôs the standalone comment it gave:
  
  ‚∏ª
  
  **Prompt I wish more people used:**
  ‚Äú*Break this down like I‚Äôm smart but unfamiliar. Give real examples, flag common misconceptions, and explain why they happen.*‚Äù
  
  It strikes a good balance‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt insult your intelligence, doesn‚Äôt assume expertise, and steers the model away from vague summaries or surface-level takes. It also prompts deeper explanations without the word bloat. The part about why people usually misunderstand this forces clarity and often brings out the real insight.
  
  That one prompt has made a huge difference for me across topics‚Äîtechnical, historical, legal, even philosophical stuff.

    "double check your answers"/"verify your sources and links" seems to work as well.

I Use this scheme which is saved in my gpts memory( summarized and written by gpt for this post).

My 4-Step Answer Framework (for clear, structured replies)

I use a simple 4-step structure to make complex answers easier to follow and to check their quality.
Here‚Äôs how it works:

‚∏ª

1) Answer (3‚Äì5 bullet points)
	‚Ä¢	Always start with the direct takeaways.
	‚Ä¢	3‚Äì5 numbered key points, no waffle.
	‚Ä¢	Think of this as: ‚ÄúIf you only read one thing, read this.‚Äù

‚∏ª

2) Reasoning (Top 3 + assumptions)
	‚Ä¢	Give the top 3 reasons behind the answer.
	‚Ä¢	Add 1‚Äì2 explicit assumptions (so it‚Äôs clear what the answer is based on).
	‚Ä¢	This keeps reasoning transparent and avoids hidden ‚Äúguesswork.‚Äù

‚∏ª

3) Alternatives (with trade-offs)
	‚Ä¢	Present alternative options.
	‚Ä¢	Each in one sentence with a clear trade-off (e.g. cost vs. effectiveness, speed vs. risk).
	‚Ä¢	Shows there‚Äôs more than one way to approach the problem.

‚∏ª

4) To-Do &amp; Quality Check
	‚Ä¢	DoD (Definition of Done): 3 quick checks (is it correct? complete? useful?).
	‚Ä¢	Self-check: note if the answer meets the DoD and why.
	‚Ä¢	Confidence level: high / medium / low.
	‚Ä¢	Sources mode (if it‚Äôs law, politics, economics, science): add 3‚Äì5 reliable, dated sources with 1-line comments.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Why this works:
	‚Ä¢	You always get a clear headline answer.
	‚Ä¢	You see why it‚Äôs the answer.
	‚Ä¢	You get alternatives and know the trade-offs.
	‚Ä¢	You get a mini quality check + sources if relevant.
