Finding ideas are super easy nowadays with social media. Go onto a professional Facebook group for a specific occupation/industry and listen to their complaints. Take note of what's working and the common questions, then introduce an MVP solution concept to get early adopters. Next, you could build a landing page, then the app.

  u/Tajammul82 ‚Ä¢ 2 points
  I really like your idea, and I‚Äôll definitely look into it.

    I've got a feature on my [Build TBD](http://buildtbd.com) app that will guide you through different form I puts to collect your resources, interests, desired business model, skills, etc and will output a business proposition. Once you have the rough idea, create a "business" in the app and go through the business model canvas. Once that is finished, the AI is always a click away - finds customer personas, aligns marketing strategies, finds jobs to be done, etc.

      The home page goes blank for me on iOS. I can see text then it blanks out.
      
      Btw I have an ad blocker. Which is probably the reason.

        u/AdNo403 ‚Ä¢ 1 points
        Are you able to scroll down? I just tested on my phone and it looks like one of the recent changes I made isn't responsive (I'll correct it soon). I added some pictures in a carousel.

          u/papillon-and-on ‚Ä¢ 2 points
          Yes, I hadn't tried that. It takes a while to get to the content though. In fact, I've tried the site on a few different browsers, some with adblockers and some without but I still see the same problem.
          
          [https://www.loom.com/share/00ffc3a7005c43c8a477dd843dd6b21e?sid=750fc27c-f0de-497c-83e5-cdb84ec04d5e](https://www.loom.com/share/00ffc3a7005c43c8a477dd843dd6b21e?sid=750fc27c-f0de-497c-83e5-cdb84ec04d5e)
          
          I had a look at the code, but unfortunately with the obfuscation from webpack combined with my lack of knowledge of Elementor I wasn't able to pinpoint the problem. My best guess is it has something to do with Elementor's implementation of swiper.js - which is a bit out of date. Your version is 8.4.5 but the latest is 11.x. But that's just a guess.

Here is the biggest secret. 

Fix shit in your life, share it, see what happens 

Try that and you have a better chance and less wasting time on something you believe would work. 

Work with feedback not YouTube as your driving source.

  u/f1xie ‚Ä¢ 1 points
  this is the move imo (and how we built our first revenue-generating startup)
  
  I always tell people to start a non-SaaS business (dropshipping, a service business, whatever) and then write software to solve the problems you encounter
  
  that's how I've found every problem that actually made money, and you simultaneously build out a case study while also making money (our non-SaaS biz actually got acquired which gave us the capital to work on the SaaS)
  
  if you don't have a business, just get one of the many insta-marketed courses out there, like [https://pdffarming.com/](https://pdffarming.com/), [https://buildatinysaas.com/](https://buildatinysaas.com/), or [https://www.dropship.io/](https://www.dropship.io/) and start (doesn't matter which -- just stick with one and get profitable)

u/Che_Ara ‚Ä¢ 13 points
You don't find ideas to build a SaaS product. Change that mindset. In business you need to start with a problem not the solution. Who knows you could solve a problem with a service, need not be a SaaS product.

Looks like you are thinking you have got technical skills specifically some tech stack which you want to put in use. It means you are solving your problem. JUST YOUR PROBLEM. That is not business.

You need to solve at least a few people's problems and if that problem is yours as well then fantastic. Depending on the scale you want to achieve, you need to pick the right problem.

  u/Tajammul82 ‚Ä¢ 1 points
  Thank you for responding‚ÄîI really like your approach and mindset. Could you suggest how I can identify problems to build a business around?

    u/Che_Ara ‚Ä¢ 4 points
    Others can't find problems for you because what we think  as problems may not be problems in your opinion. Or those problems may not inspire you. Or you don't have enough resources to solve those problems. So you need to figure that out.
    
    As a kid, I saw my parents failing in multiple businesses. That is my motivation to do business.
    
    I entered IT field in the early 2000s (I am an accidental software professional). With that experience, I decided to do a technology enabled business. I found a passion for edtech domain because I struggled to complete my education. So, I concluded to build something for that.
    
    That is how you decide what you want to build. I hope you get that.
    
    It doesn't end there. Your passion doesn't matter if the market doesn't need your product like what I developed. Without studying or understanding well, I spent time and money building a social networking platform exclusively for indian society. It failed terribly. So, you don't make that mistake. 
    
    Whatever you build, get enough validation and build it small.

      Thank you for responding and I appreciate your approach. I won‚Äôt pursue this idea further; I‚Äôll focus solely on building my passion. Thanks for your suggestion.

Idas are everywhere, ideas are mostly generic and inbounded, but instead problems are context based, specific and more importants to focus on:

Many people talk about the concept, without clarifying it, here an example to understand the difference:

Idea: build and inventory management system for companies.

Problem: distribution companies always need to search in inventory and warehouses, they can't operate without a system that can search and get items information in real time, so they can timely serve their customer.

Search here is the pain point.. So, when you want to build an inventory management system, starting with the problem means prioritize first how to solve the main pain points first, and if many of your product user personnas have he same pain point, then chances you have a good product market segment fit. And, so on you expend your product solution based on the problem first not the idea itself.

Imo you either find a niche problem that no one bothered to solve, like others said here or you find problems that were not possible to solve before LLM or reasoning models maybe. Or both

I am building a research tool that was not possible to build without LLMs for example. It can save my users a lot of time to screen them manually/ expensive to hire people to do it.
