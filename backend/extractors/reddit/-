So Claude Skills dropped last week and honestly, I‚Äôve been down a rabbit hole watching what the community‚Äôs been shipping. For those who haven‚Äôt tried it yet - Skills are basically persistent instructions/code/resources that Claude can load when it needs them. Once you install a Skill, Claude just knows how to do that thing across all your conversations.

The crazy part? People are building genuinely useful stuff in HOURS, not weeks.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found so far:

üî• The Meta One: Skill-Creator

Anthropic made a Skill that builds Skills for you. Yeah, you read that right.
You just describe what you want in plain English, and it writes the SKILL.md file for you. I tested it yesterday and it‚Äôs actually really good.
Demo (47 seconds): https://youtube.com/watch?v=kS1MJFZWMq4

ü§ñ Auto-Generation Tool: Skill Seekers

u/Critical-Pea-8782 built something wild - a tool that auto-generates Claude Skills from ANY documentation site.
- Feed it a docs URL
- Wait 25 minutes
- Get a production-ready Skill

It has presets for React, Vue, Django, Godot, FastAPI‚Ä¶ basically any major framework.
GitHub: https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers
I tried this with the Godot docs and it actually works. The Skill it generated knows way more about Godot than base Claude.

üìö Community Collections

A few people have started curating all the Skills being created:

BehiSecc‚Äôs Collection:
https://github.com/BehiSecc/awesome-claude-skills
Includes: CSV analyzers, research assistants, YouTube transcript fetchers, EPUB parsers, git automation, and a bunch more.

travisvn‚Äôs Collection:
https://github.com/travisvn/awesome-claude-skills
Similar vibe but with more enterprise/workflow focus. Both are actively maintained and honestly just browsing these gives you ideas.

üé® Official Anthropic Skills Pack

Anthropic shipped 15 Skills out of the gate. The document creation ones are actually really impressive:
- docx - Creates proper Word docs (not just markdown pretending to be Word)
- pptx - Actual PowerPoint files with layouts, charts, etc.
- xlsx - Excel with real formulas
- pdf - Form filling and manipulation
- canvas-design - Visual layouts in PNG/PDF
- brand-guidelines - Keeps everything on-brand
- algorithmic-art - Generative art with p5.js
- slack-gif-creator - Makes GIFs that fit Slack‚Äôs constraints

Plus more for internal comms, web testing, MCP server creation, etc.
GitHub: https://github.com/anthropics/skills
The document-skills folder is particularly interesting if you want to see how Anthropic approaches complex Skills.

üß† Simon Willison‚Äôs Take: ‚ÄúBigger Than MCP‚Äù

Simon Willison (the guy who reverse-engineered Skills before the official announcement) wrote a really good technical breakdown:
https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/

TLDR: Skills are more token-efficient than MCP and way easier to share. Each Skill only uses a few dozen tokens until it‚Äôs actually needed, then Claude loads the full details.
His take is that Skills might end up being more important than MCP in the long run. Honestly? After using both, I kinda see his point.

üé¨ Official Demo: Skills Chaining

Anthropic‚Äôs demo shows Skills working together automatically:
PowerPoint Skill ‚Üí Brand Guidelines Skill ‚Üí Poster Design Skill
All in one conversation. Claude just switches between them as needed.
Video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=IoqpBKrNaZI

ü§î My Honest Take

I‚Äôve been using Claude for months and Skills genuinely feel different. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúbetter prompts‚Äù - it‚Äôs more like giving Claude actual expertise that sticks around.
The best part? Everything‚Äôs open-source. You can fork Skills, modify them, share them with your team. The barrier to entry is super low.

Downsides I‚Äôve noticed:
- Some Skills work better than others (canvas-design got roasted on HN)
- You need Claude Pro/Team/Enterprise (not available on free tier)
- It‚Äôs still early - some rough edges
But overall? This feels like a real step forward in making AI actually useful for specific workflows.

üì¢ What are you building?

Has anyone else been experimenting with Skills? What have you built? What Skills do you wish existed?
I‚Äôm particularly curious if anyone‚Äôs made Skills for:
- API documentation (specific to your company)
- Data analysis workflows
- Content creation pipelines
- Design systems

Drop your Skills in the comments - let‚Äôs build this library together üëá

**Flair:** Built with Claude

Can we ban the term production ready? Also it‚Äôs kinda like having Claude auto pick the correct project for a task which is where people would‚Äôve put this type of custom instructioning and acc it‚Äôs useful.

  u/satansprinter ‚Ä¢ 23 points
  Why ban the term? Its a dead give away for me its made with claude

    u/FengMinIsVeryLoud ‚Ä¢ -4 points
    because dario and his team arent able to create products which can create production ready products.
    
    openai is way closer to "can".

  u/bitspace ‚Ä¢ 4 points
  &gt;Can we ban the term production ready?
  
  Why, except for the fact that absolutely nobody who's ever posted in this subreddit has actually shipped anything to production?

List of Python libraries available in the environment: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/87ae1fd6-3817-4af9-8459-8d5c6b9bc490

(From Claude running `pip list --format=freeze | sort` in the skills execution environment)

u/Basic_Investigator44 ‚Ä¢ 12 points
Very helpful! Thanks a lot

u/EzraCy123 ‚Ä¢ 11 points
Can anyone describe the difference btw asking Claude to use skill x to do y, or making a Claude agent whose assignment is to do y (where agent prompt contains instructions that would effectively be content equivalent to skill x?

  u/delphianQ ‚Ä¢ 7 points
  Skills mean same context window, but claude will more naturally invoke the skill. Agent is separate context window, but more hamfisted delegation.
  
  With work you can already make an agent skill like, but it will never be as smooth.

  It is called reinventing the wheel. Anthropic is trying to be innovative and get ahead of the curve so they keep coming up with stuff like this.
  
  
  Its bespoke¬†

    u/elbiot ‚Ä¢ 2 points
    When the wheel has only been around for a year I think it's reasonable to reinvent it a few times

    u/Brilliant-Lettuce544 ‚Ä¢ 1 points
    And OpenAI is obviously playing catchup with things like ACP (Agentic Commerce Protocol) or wtf they called it

u/142857t ‚Ä¢ 15 points
Very helpful post but one small comment: the formatting is broken. I assume you copied from somewhere (e.g. output of LLM) and the bullet points are completely messed up, making certain parts confusing to read.

  u/Zestyclose-Ad-9003 ‚Ä¢ -22 points
  Thanks for the feedback. Will keep the formatting right 
  To clarify, Its a messup between notion to Reddit copy paste :)

    u/m-shottie ‚Ä¢ 27 points
    ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Please, this has definitely been through an LLM
    
    Edit: to match OPs edit - they were claiming an LLM was not used to produce the post.

      u/Infinite-Rent1903 ‚Ä¢ 8 points
      That always have the same style and  tone ‚Äúso, I was ‚Ä¶‚Äù

        u/drop_carrier ‚Ä¢ 31 points
        So \[thing happened\] and honestly? \["hot take"\] \[rabbit hole\] \[deep dive\]
        
        \[The crazy part?\] / \[here's what blew my mind\]
        
        \[List stuff from LLM output request about topic\]
        
        \[emoji header list\]
        
        \[It's not x, it's y\]
        
        \[call to action\]
        
        It's \*not hard\* to get an LLM to sound genuine and use your own unique tone of voice.

          Hahah fuckin nailed it

          u/ProfessionalAnt1352 ‚Ä¢ 6 points
          genuinely, it takes bare minimum effort to get them to talk naturally

          u/bitspace ‚Ä¢ 2 points
          Jesus I'm going to write some kind of reddit post filter using this template because it's _spot on_

            u/drop_carrier ‚Ä¢ 1 points
            Thanks. I run a weekly ‚Äòno-hype‚Äô newsletter for stuff like this. Link in bio. And if you ever write that filter I would LOVE to know.

    u/142857t ‚Ä¢ 6 points
    I mean, no problem with the LLM usage if any! The point is that you have clearly put effort into researching for this which is super helpful.

      u/Zestyclose-Ad-9003 ‚Ä¢ -4 points
      fixed it :D

    u/exboozeme ‚Ä¢ 1 points
    Notion is the absolute worst to copy out of. They clearly made it so brutal so you can‚Äôt easily get your content out.

---

u/ascendant23 ‚Ä¢ 10 points
I mean, at the end of the day, it's basically "premade prompt parts with progressive disclosure," right? So, super useful as a feature, but not really anything you couldn't already do by copy pasting useful instructions from Notepad or something. Like, yes, this does seem smart for them to have built into the UI, but I don't think it's anywhere near as game-changing as MCP, which basically lets you use the same set of tools anywhere regardless of which model provider / framework / etc.

  u/Throwaway_bicycling ‚Ä¢ 3 points
  Willison‚Äôs post makes the important point that this approach to skills is pretty generic, so you might well see a lot of this implemented much more broadly. Like today you can feed skills to Gemini CLI in your prompt and it will basically work. Less fancy than having Claude itself figure out what skills to use, so maybe the tokens savings isn‚Äôt as large, but I‚Äôm betting other systems will build on the idea.

u/tehsilentwarrior ‚Ä¢ 6 points
It‚Äôs sort of bash scripts isn‚Äôt it?

  u/Zestyclose-Ad-9003 ‚Ä¢ 3 points
  Indeed if you zoom out from it

---

u/EarthlingSil ‚Ä¢ 3 points
Can Skills be used to create a account wide prompt that Claude must follow for every single conversation, like the one available in LM Studio?

  u/ProfessionalAnt1352 ‚Ä¢ 3 points
  if you're on web you can use projects and simply throw that in the project instructions. not the references, the actual instructions block. it gets sent up in your initial message as if it was part of the prompt.   
    
  alternatively when starting claude through your console you can start it through a .bat that auto sends up the initial prompt when running it.
  
  apologies if I misunderstood your question, but I believe this is sort of what you're looking for?

  u/elbiot ‚Ä¢ 0 points
  In CC that's CLAUDE.md
  
  But there's no "must follow" for LLMs. All you can do is put stuff in the context and it's up to you to make that context sufficient for conditioning the output the way you want

u/JohanTHEDEV ‚Ä¢ 3 points
This feels really powerful, I see more need for "in the moment workflows" rather then n8n type of automations. And the space is emerging.

---

u/Pack_New69 ‚Ä¢ 2 points
Dang! I can‚Äôt wait to try it‚Ä¶

---

u/adampao ‚Ä¢ 2 points
Thanks for the post. I haven‚Äôt had the chance to play with skills yet, but it‚Äôs next on to-do list. It sounded like a super useful tool from the release announcement, and it seems like it‚Äôs delivering.

u/Thump604 ‚Ä¢ 2 points
I just explained this toClaude it now have skills put to work!  This ish is amazing!!

What even is Claude skills

  u/elbiot ‚Ä¢ 1 points
  A very detailed prompt specific to a particular task that gets dropped into context when needed

u/Key-Singer-2193 ‚Ä¢ 2 points
Can anthropic fix their console.anthropic.com


Have any of you logged in and tried to use that site on your phone? It's terrible yet they keep pushing out these new features instead of taking care of home-base first¬†

u/Original_Buffalo2485 ‚Ä¢ 1 points
I'm not gonna read this all but is "skill" free? I'm a free user and I've seen it but I couldn't turn it on so

  u/uncoolbob ‚Ä¢ 1 points
  It's for paid accounts only.

u/takaji10 ‚Ä¢ 1 points
Has anyone made a skill that handles translation of documents? I'm trying, but the output always fails for one reason or another...

---

u/Maralitabambolo ‚Ä¢ 1 points
Skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers‚Ä¶the one thing tech people suck at is making things simple for the mass. 

Yes skills are useful, but specifically for coders, what does it change? The design part is nice and I expect designers to have fun with it, fun but maybe break those out by profession / need might help.

---

u/ProfessionalAnt1352 ‚Ä¢ 1 points
How many of these skills are viable with the new usage limits? This isn't a rant, this is a genuine question as I can't figure out a way to reliably use claude for everyday tasks now on current usage limits
