Hello!

I am getting pretty far along in my dev journey and I am getting way more confident. I am currently working on an API in go and have a few live projects deployed for my current job.

Up to this point, I have been using mongo db and I have came to the realization that for most of my projects I need structured data long-term. I can spin up an instance of postgres on railway, but I do not know if this is the best option cost-wise.

Does anyone have any opinions about the best place to host your postgres instance?

Also, I've considered just building a docker image with both my api and postgres running together, or even just using sqlite. I guess I am a little concerned about keeping my data if I shift my place of deployment.

For instance, if I simply go with sqlite for the time being, and I get tons of data, I am not sure how I would get that data out of my deployment and migrate it to another database.

Any thoughts?

Is this for learning or for the projects you mentioned in current job?

  For learning. All of my projects I have live in my job are "bots" that automate tasks.  
  
  
  For example, I have a few bots that go run analytics on our data and then messages it out / updates digital signage in our business.  
  
  
  Another one runs and gets time punch errors. Another generates reimbursement invoices from our credit card statements. Tasks like this.  
  
  
  BUT I am working on a web app which can help with some of our internal systems. Right now we rely heavily on good forms and spread sheets but I believe I could simplify by creating a web app. BUT it would all be heavily dependent on the data fed into the app.

    I would probably go with docker and docker-compose to set up the db and server and dependencies. Make sure to set it up so the data persists.

Supabase uses Postgres for their DB. You can host 2 projects for free.

Railway is good but they do shut off your free projects pretty quick for inactivity. I ended up putting 20 bucks on my railway account and am now running express servers for two portfolio projects for a couple bucks a month.
