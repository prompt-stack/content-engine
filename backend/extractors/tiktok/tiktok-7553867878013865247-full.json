  "transcript": "You will not be shocked to hear this.\nHere is Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina,\nrunning for reelection,\nmaking exactly the same case that Beto O'rourke made.\nWatch. Section 2 30 needs to be repealed.\nIf you're mad at social media companies that radicalize our nation,\nyou should be mad, senator.\nOn the Bill that will allow you to sue these people.\nThey're immune from lawsuit.\nOh, it should be repealed.\nNow, it's not clear from that clip\nexactly why Lindsay Graham is calling for the repeal of Section 2 30.\nWhy is he threatening the tech platforms?\nAnd by the way, the pretext always changes.\nThey'll tell you, well,\nwe're against child sex trafficking.\nAs if anyone is for it. We're against terrorism,\na term, once again,\nthey never define and don't have to.\nWe're against drugs, we're against foreign influence,\nwe're against bigotry, whatever.\nThey will always give you an excuse,\nand that excuse will make them sound like the virtuous party,\nlike the good guys. We're here to save the vulnerable,\nbut that's never the real reason.\nCensorship always and everywhere is imposed with the intent\nand always has the effect\nof shielding the powerful.\nThey're the ones who don't want to be exposed.\nFree speech, by contrast,\nand this is the reason it's in our Bill of rights,\nis the one great power that the powerless have.\nEspecially in a world where your vote may or may not matter.\nAll you have is your voice.\nAll You have is your opinion.\nAnd that's infuriating to Lindsay Graham's donors.\nAnd make no mistake\nwhen he's calling for invoking Section 2:30 and taking it away,\nthreatening the big platforms,\nhe's doing that on behalf of his donors\nwho feel criticized by random accounts on the internet.\nAnd they hate it\nbecause the people in charge always hate to be called out.\nCensorship has one goal, and that's to preserve secrecy.\nAnd secrecy has one purpose,\nand that's to abet wrongdoing.\nSo people who are doing nothing wrong are transparent.\nPeople who are committing evil hide.\nAnd censorship allows them to hide.\nIt's literally that simple.\nAnd those people are the most powerful people in the country.\nSo who's encouraging this?\nThe donors, whoever they are.\nBut there are lots of lobby groups,\nall of them on the left, pushing the Republican LED Congress\nto get behind censorship initiatives,\nusing the cover of the Section 2 30 debate to get it done.\nTo pressure the tech companies into making you shut up,\ninto taking your opinions off the internet.\nUsing algorithms designed to censor you\nwithout even a human being entering into the equation.\nNo person will decide that your opinion is offensive and pull it off.\nThe computer will decide that.\nAnd will be aided by the massive\nexponential growth in computing power\nthat is at the very center of tech right now.\nAI,\nthat is the goal. To make certain\nthat opinions that are disruptive to the People in charge\nnever see the light of day.\nWhat's amazing and what's especially infuriating\nis that many in the Republican Party,\nthe party that controls all branches of government right now,\nare completely for this, strongly for it.\nWhere did they get this idea?\nIs this a betrayal? Oh,\nit's a betrayal. How profound a betrayal.",
