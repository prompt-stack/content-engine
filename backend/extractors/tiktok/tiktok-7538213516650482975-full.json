The cops done played target practice with a lot of my niggas.\nPoured out liquor for a lot of my niggas.\nSo much, they bottled it,\nbuilt a liquor store and put a fucking lottery in.\nWe in a lottery, nigga.\nFor the lives of a lot of these niggas.\nThey picking sevens and they scratching off a lot of these niggas.\nI didn't send birthday cards\nto parents with nothing but apologies in them. Like,\nI am sorry, Mr.\nRainy, Sean Bell was gonna marry your daughter.\nAnd you know we want to thank you for the way that she was bought up.\nAnd you know that we were smiling when we seen that call.\nHe bought.\nAnd you sent you from heaven when you seen that boy get slaughtered.\nBut how could Kanye ever complain\nabout what the accident did to his left eye?\nCause they shot that boy in his left eye,\nleft him caca\ncause they let the Glock slide right towards his right eye.\nHe's only fly in terms that he just died\nbecause the first cut right through his polo shirt.\nLike, mother,\nfuck your fly. I'm trying to keep you alive.\nI'm gonna be the one who has to tell your mother that you just died.",
