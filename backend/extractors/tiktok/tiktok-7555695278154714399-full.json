  "transcript": "This is a day in my life.\nI started the morning by going on a run on my private beach.\nThen a little after I got home,\nme and my mom decided to go out for lunch.\nWe went to our favourite Indian buffet\nbecause we both love Indian food.\nAnd it was so good. And it was only $50.\nThen we started heading home because I have a lot of school work to do.\nI haven't done a single assignment all year.\nAfter two hours of grinding,\nI went to my nail appointment and I almost forgot the keys in my car.\nI love getting my nails done on Sundays.\nIt just sets the mood for the whole week.\nI also got a back massage and it was only $80.\nThey turned out so cute.\nThen I went to Starbucks and I got a pumpkin spice frappe.\nThen when I got home, I couldn't find my black aloe set anywhere,\nand I really wanted to wear it to school tomorrow,\nso I ordered another one. I think Doordash delivers it,\nso it came in, like,\ntwo hours and it was so cute.\nThen I decided to go in my steam room.\nIt's my favourite thing ever.",
