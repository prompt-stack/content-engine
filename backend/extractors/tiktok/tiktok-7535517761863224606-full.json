  "transcript": "alright so we're gonna be focusing on building products and services with a I\nbut more specifically we're gonna be focused on doing automations\nand we're also gonna be focusing on web application\nthese are gonna be the two things that we really focus on\nfor being able to build products and service with\nwith artificial intelligence\nand now I spelt all its automations wrong\nand automations these could be internal automations for yourself\nor being able to build automations for other people\nor building web applications for yourself locally on your machine\nor if you venture out to build products and services for yourself\nthe really the first\nthe primary goal is to be able to build these for yourself first\nto be able to really solve your own problems\nthen you can begin to solve the problems for other people\nbecause these are the most valuable ways to build businesses\nour first focus point is gonna be on computer science\nfor non computer science people\nI can relate to those of you who are trying to figure out this a I\nstuff as a person who wasn't classically trained in computer science\nI didn't go to school for computer science\nI've self taught myself\nso it's very possible for you to be able to teach yourself\nbut you have to get the language of the computer scientist\nbecause we're working with artificial intelligence and language models\nit's very important for you to understand really\nthe driving force as to how these things were created\nand so we're gonna spend some time on the language of computer science\nbut it's not gonna be focused on you becoming computer scientist\nthis guy right here his name is Claude Shannon\nI'm I'm probably\nit's a guess but I'd\nI'd imagine that Claude who anthropic\nthis is their a I model is named after this guy\nbut he he's really the founder and architect of the field of study\ninformation systems\nand I bring up information systems because we will spend some time on here\nwhen we're learning about the language of information\nwhich is intelligence and then systemising it\nwe're gonna get into automation and algorithms\nbut if you can understand low entropy and high entropy\nand so really you're\nyou're just thinking about how do you systematize information\nhow do you turn intelligence into something that's actionable\nparticularly over a digital mediums or digital spaces\nright or digital products\nand so we're gonna spend some time thinking about what this looks like\nand developing the vocabulary\nwhich is low entropy and high entropy words\nfor being able to communicate in the form of information systems\nand so what do I mean by low and high entry words\nlow entry is just think of this as just very simple basic\nwhen you're talking if you're working in like lovable\nif you're working in uh\nchat G P t\nand it it\nit you say\njust fix this or write me a blog\npost or just do stuff very\nvery simple very rudimentary\nvery elementary understanding of a particular subject matter\nhigh entropy is when you're able to speak the language\nof a subject matter expert\nand you can signal to a large language model\nat least directionally on what you wanna do\nit's a difference between saying hey\nI want you to be able to fix this webpage\nor I want you to be able to design me a three page um\nwebsite with the heroes gonna be this size\nI want you to be able to use react\nI want you to be able to use Python for the backend\nbeing able to communicate in this way exponentially changes the outputs uh\nfrom your large language models\nand so finally this is gonna be our first module\num I think we're gonna have maybe five or six modules\nbut our first module is gonna be focusing on the language\nthe language of the building blocks that go with computer science\nor that go with working with a I systems\nwe're gonna focus on abstraction\nand this is really just gonna help you to think in layers\nand we'll get into what abstraction is and why this is important\nbut you can think of this as being able to think in layers\nto be able to see beyond just the surface layer\nof how a particular system operates\nand then we're gonna get into data structures\nbecause you have to understand the way in which an a I\nsystem or a large language model is speaking\nit's speaking in data it's speaking in information right\nand so how does it organise and exchange this data\nand algorithms are really just thinking of this as a step by step\nprocedural way of being able to communicate\nhow can you be able to get the same outcome with the same repeatable process\nso think of this as like your recipe book right\nhow do you how do you cook up from your recipe book\nand then a P I's are really\nhow do these a I models communicate back to each other right\nhow do they speak you\nyou do need to know that you need a P I\nkeys in order to access some of the software\nand so we'll get into that\nand then it's the client and server relationship\nif you ever worked inside the service industry\nyou can think of this as like the front of the house and the back of the house\nthe front of the house is like the wait staff and the hostess\nthese are all these are all customer facing people right\nthis is the client\nand then you have a back of the house which is gonna be like the cooks\ngonna be the people cooking it up\nthis is gonna be your server\nbut we'll get into all of this\nin terms of understanding how these five core building blocks can really\nchange your understanding of how you build web applications\nand automations or using a I\nto be able to help you in this process\nand so this is what we're cooking up\num if you want to be a part of this course\nyou can go and hit the link in the bio on my beakers and just drop your email\nI'll shoot you a email as soon as this comes together\nbut this is right now what I'm working on\nit'll probably be in this format where me filming and also using like\nthis canvas to be able to go through some of the concepts\nand then of course we'll do live demonstrations\num we'll work in V s C o\nwe'll work with um\ncursor we'll work with some of the other automated I d E s\nwe'll have some projects that you'll be able to create\num but anyway\nI just wanna give some insights and preview\nI'm also practicing building in public um\nand so I'm excited for this\nand so let me know your thoughts\ngive any kind of recommendations in the comments um\nand we'll continue to push forward\nalright peace y'all",
