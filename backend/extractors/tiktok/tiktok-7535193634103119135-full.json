  "transcript": "so I wanna show you how like\nwhat this looks like when you have an agent as\nlike an assistant\num so I'm editing this video\nthis is the video that I last video I just did right\nso this is inside of my Adobe Premiere\nso I have Adobe Premiere and so inside of here\nI always I get the transcript for my video as well\nso you see the transcript gets created and the video\nI chop it up a little bit for TikTok\nI just let it freestyle on YouTube\nso if you want the unedited version\nget on YouTube and so what do I do\nI come here and I say I want to export this now\nexport out the transcript\nand so that the workflow of the pipeline isn't built yet\nbut in real time you're gonna see what it looks like\nand so I export this into a text file\nand then I export it into a location to where my agent\ncause remember we talked about agents right\nmy agent can have access to it\nso my agent has access to everything inside of my drive\nif I go inside the tools I have something in YouTube\nand then I have a YouTube uploader and I have videos\nso I download the video here\nthis is a transcript for the video that gets downloaded\nboom it gets downloaded\nthen I come back the video's been edited\nI come back to here and I export the video right\nI export media and so you can see here the video is already done\nand right folder and so this is gonna go like I said in my drive\nwe're going on tools we're going on YouTube\nbecause this is what my agent has access to\nand so I download here I save and I hit export\nand so then it's gonna export\nwe're gonna wait a couple minutes and then we'll come back to the video\nalright so we have three seconds left on the video and it's gonna be exported\nalright so the video has been exported\nnow remember in our last video\nwe talked about agents and clock code\nand being able to give our agent just a path\na file path and then it being able to go do work for us\nso in this case I want my agents to go take the video that I just recorded\nand I want it to be able to upload it to YouTube for me right\njust walk through the process\nit's gonna create the description\ncreate the title create the thumbnail\nand then upload everything to YouTube\nthe agent can take care of this\nand so I just have to give it access right\nand so remember this is my draft\nwe went inside of tools we went inside of YouTube\nand so here's kind of my YouTube ecosystem\nthis is everything that I've built for my agent to be able to\nto work with and so we're gonna filter through the uh\nlast created date which is\ntoday is the fifth and so here\nhere is the video here's the video right here\nhere's the transcript and so what can I do\nI say here's the file path\nhere's the file path and then I'm gonna go put that into my terminal\nbecause that's how we give requests to our agents\nand so I'm gonna clear out this message\nand so I'm gonna give my agent this folder\nand I'm gonna also give my agent this one and this\nso these are the two files that Claude is gonna focus on right\nthese are it right here\nand so what I'm gonna tell Claude is that this is what I need you to do\nI need you to use this copy path\nbecause this has all the instructions inside of it\nfor how Claude can go and upload to YouTube\ncan create transcript can create etcetera etcetera etcetera\nand so you tell it I want you to process this video and transcript using\nand then I'll give it this\nand then you hit enter and so what Claude is gonna do is go in and read\nit's gonna say okay\nyou gave me a video you also gave me a\na transcript now I'm gonna go and read in the YouTube uploader tool\nand it says it's cooking ha ha\nGoliath says I'm cooking G\nlet me get to work now\nI process your video and transcript\nlet me first copy the files to the uploads directory\nright it's doing its thing\nit's doing exactly what it's gonna do\nand you're gonna go and see where it's saying\nhere's the uploads directory where it's gonna put it\nand here is where the video is\nalright so I'm gonna preview\npreview the video alright\nso I'm gonna give you a breakdown of what these are\nalright so that's me\na I Claude just put the J song file there\nso this is what Claude just created\nso I just created this whole video on the terminal\nhere's the title here's the description um\nand it's broken\nClaude you didn't do it right\nha ha\num let me create better meta data\nso Claude checked it and saw that it was broken\nhe's like oh\nI made a mistake let me\nlet me fix it and so it comes back\nand as you can see in real time\nClaude is fixing this file\nhere's the here's what it says\nClaude says he created a file\na I agent tutorial\nClaude code and terminal run a I\nassistance on your computer\nthen it gives a complete description with the transcript and everything\nwith the tags and then here's the entire transcript that goes with the video\nand so Claude is now processing all of that\nand now it's gonna choke make an attempt to upload the video um\nand so it's also gonna do the thumbnail\nI don't know if I've configured it yet\nbecause I'm like man\npeople just to see this\nI'm in real time building this content pipeline for my a I\nassistant and so we'll just see what it in the okay\nand so it says what it did\nand so it has now created the metadata\nand now it says I'm ready to upload this to YouTube\nwould you do you have other videos you wanna upload\nyou also have to now put in your YouTube a P I credentials\nI haven't set this up yet\nbut as you can see if I tell Clyde hey\ncan you also create a thumbnail for this video\nand so Claude is gonna say ah maybe\nlet me check ha ha\nyou know I'm not sure if I can um\nand so it goes and it says oh\nthere's a generate thumbnail\nyes of course I can generate your thumbnail\nand so that's exactly what it does\nit it hit a snag\nbut you can see how Claude is gonna self correct itself\nI don't know if I have my open a I\nkeys in there um\ndo I may not have my open a I\nkeys so I may not have it\nno I haven't put my a P I\nkeys in there um\nso we'll come back I'll show you\nbut then Claude is saying yes\nI can generate a thumbnail\nbut I have to put in my a P I keys\nso I don't have my a P I keys in there\nI need to get my YouTube a P I\nand my am I open\na I a P I\nkeys and a P I keys are just really secrets\num we'll\nwe'll create another video\na P I keys\nha ha maybe that's something we'll go over in our coursework\nbut as you can see here cloud would then upload this to YouTube\nand it would be able to see it\nand so imagine I'm just this is just another um\nreal use case in how I use agents to be able to facilitate work um\non my computer and so let me know if you have any questions\num I'm gonna get my a P I\nkeys installed\nand then I'm gonna run through it again so you can see how it works\nand so every time I probably do a video\nI run through and record my screen just to show you how\njust how much it can speed you up on just small micro efficiencies\nalright peace y'all",
