# Tier 1 Security Protections - Implementation Summary

## Status: ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

Railway deployment: https://content-engine-production.up.railway.app

---

## Implemented Features

### 1. Rate Limiting (slowapi)

**Status:** ✅ Implemented with Redis backend

**Configuration:**
- LLM endpoints: 10 requests/minute
- Extractor endpoints: 5 requests/minute
- Redis storage for distributed rate limiting across Railway instances

**Files modified:**
- `app/core/limiter.py` - Centralized limiter with Redis/memory fallback
- `app/api/endpoints/llm.py` - Applied `@limiter.limit()` decorators
- `app/api/endpoints/extractors.py` - Applied `@limiter.limit()` decorators
- `app/main.py` - Registered limiter and exception handler
- `requirements.txt` - Added `slowapi==0.1.9`

**Known Limitation:**
IP-based rate limiting may not be fully effective on Railway due to proxy/load balancer configuration. This is a known issue with cloud platforms and will be addressed in **Tier 2** with per-user rate limiting.

---

### 2. Feature Flags for Cost Control

**Status:** ✅ Implemented and working

**Environment Variables:**
- `ENABLE_LLM` - Controls access to all LLM endpoints (default: `false`)
- `ENABLE_EXTRACTORS` - Controls access to content extraction endpoints (default: `false`)

**Behavior:**
- When disabled, endpoints return HTTP 503 with message:
  *"[Feature] features are currently disabled for cost control. Please contact administrator."*
- Allows instant kill switch for expensive operations without redeployment

**Files modified:**
- `app/core/config.py` - Added feature flags
- `app/api/endpoints/llm.py` - Check flags before processing
- `app/api/endpoints/extractors.py` - Check flags before processing

**Current Railway Settings:**
```
ENABLE_LLM=true
ENABLE_EXTRACTORS=true
```

---

### 3. API Key Authentication

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Configuration:**
- Simple header-based authentication for public API access
- Optional - only enforced if `API_SECRET_KEY` is set in environment
- Header: `X-API-Key: your-secret-key`

**Files modified:**
- `app/api/deps.py` - `verify_api_key()` dependency
- `app/core/config.py` - Added `API_SECRET_KEY` setting
- All public endpoints - Added `Depends(verify_api_key)`

**Behavior:**
- If `API_SECRET_KEY` not set → API key check is bypassed (for local dev)
- If `API_SECRET_KEY` is set → All requests must include valid `X-API-Key` header

---

### 4. Railway Production Deployment

**Status:** ✅ HEALTHY

**Deployment URL:** https://content-engine-production.up.railway.app
**Healthcheck:** `GET /health` → HTTP 200

**Services Deployed:**
- `content-engine` (backend API)
- `Postgres` (database)
- `Redis` (rate limiting storage)

**Environment Variables Configured:**
- `DATABASE_URL` → `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`
- `REDIS_URL` → `${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}`
- All API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.)
- Feature flags (`ENABLE_LLM`, `ENABLE_EXTRACTORS`)

**Key Fixes:**
1. **Async driver issue** - Modified `app/db/session.py` and `alembic/env.py` to convert `postgresql://` URLs to `postgresql+asyncpg://` for async SQLAlchemy support
2. **Redis connection** - Set up reference variable for distributed rate limiting

---

## Testing Summary

### Local Testing
✅ Rate limiting works correctly (tested with 12 rapid requests → first 10 succeed, 11-12 rate limited)
✅ Feature flags work (LLM/extractor endpoints return 503 when disabled)
✅ API key authentication works (401 without key, 200 with valid key)

### Railway Testing
✅ Healthcheck passing (HTTP 200)
✅ API endpoints responding correctly
✅ Database connection working
✅ Redis connection established
⚠️ IP-based rate limiting ineffective (expected - see Known Limitations)

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work (Tier 2+)

### 1. Rate Limiting Effectiveness on Railway
**Issue:** IP-based rate limiting doesn't work reliably on Railway due to proxy/load balancer infrastructure

**Impact:** Moderate - Rate limiting code is in place but may not prevent abuse effectively

**Solution:** Implement **per-user rate limiting** in Tier 2
- Track limits by `user_id` instead of IP address
- Requires authenticated users
- Much more effective for preventing abuse

---

### 2. Frontend Input Sanitization
**Status:** Not yet implemented

**Recommended:** Add DOMPurify to frontend to prevent XSS attacks

**Priority:** Medium (Tier 2)

---

### 3. Advanced Security Features

**Recommended for Tier 3:**
- Request signing/HMAC verification
- Rate limiting by user tier (free vs paid)
- Geographic rate limiting
- Anomaly detection
- IP allowlisting/blocklisting

## Quick Reference

### Check Deployment Status
```bash
railway status
railway logs
```

### Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://content-engine-production.up.railway.app/health
```

### Test Rate Limiting (Local)
```bash
# Run 12 requests quickly - requests 11-12 should be rate limited
for i in {1..12}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:9765/api/extract/article \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
    -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
done
```

### Toggle Features
Set in Railway dashboard → Variables:
```
ENABLE_LLM=false      # Disable all LLM endpoints
ENABLE_EXTRACTORS=false  # Disable all extractor endpoints
```

## Conclusion

✅ **Tier 1 Security Protections Successfully Deployed**

The production API now has:
- Rate limiting infrastructure (ready for user-based limits in Tier 2)
- Cost control via feature flags
- Basic API key authentication
- Healthy Railway deployment with Redis and Postgres

**Next Steps:** Tier 2 implementation
1. Per-user rate limiting (fixes Railway limitation)
2. Frontend input sanitization (DOMPurify)
3. Enhanced monitoring and logging
